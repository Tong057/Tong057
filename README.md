My professional background enables me to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions. My skill set covers a wide range of tasks — from building web and mobile applications to developing server-side data processing systems and machine learning algorithms.

### Main areas of expertise:
— Classic desktop applications: WPF / WinForms / .NET MAUI / AvaloniaUI
